# 1. Initialization

# Define nodes and connections
N = {N1, N2, ..., Nn}  # Set of universal nodes, each representing any entity or purpose
C_ij = {C_ij for all i, j}  # Connections between nodes

# Initialize conductivity and insulation for connections
sigma_ij = initial_value  # Conductivity
rho_ij = initial_value  # Insulation

# 2. Energy Calculation and State Update

# Local Energy Calculation with Damping Factor
E_ij = (sigma_ij * abs(S_i - S_j)) / lambda  # Energy between nodes N_i and N_j with damping

# State Update Rule with Normalization
S_j_new = S_j_old + eta * (sum(E_ij for all i) / sum(sigma_ij for all i))  # Update state S_j

# 3. Dynamic Conductivity and Insulation Adjustment

# Conductivity Adjustment with Proportional Update
sigma_ij_new = sigma_ij_old + alpha * ((E_ij - theta_sigma) / max(theta_sigma, 1))  # Adjust conductivity

# Insulation Adjustment with Proportional Update
rho_ij_new = rho_ij_old + beta * ((theta_rho - E_ij) / max(theta_rho, 1))  # Adjust insulation

# 4. Pruning Mechanism

# Connection Pruning with Energy-Dependent Threshold
C_ij_prune = 0 if rho_ij > theta_prune * (sum(E_ij for all i, j) / lambda) else C_ij  # Prune connections

# 5. Convergence and Output Solidification

# Convergence Criteria with Moving Average
converged = (MA(sum(abs(E_ij_new - E_ij_old) for all i, j)) < epsilon)  # Check if system has stabilized

# Final State and Output
S_f = {S_1, S_2, ..., S_n}  # Final states of nodes representing the learned or stable output

# 6. Final Network Structure

# The final network consists of:
# - Nodes with solidified states S_f
# - Pruned connections C_ij representing efficient pathways
